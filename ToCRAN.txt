CRAN submission BoostHeaders 1.15.0-0

We have read and agreed to the CRAN policies.  We note that
the package is larger than usually recommended, and explain
the reason for this, below.  In particular, it will ultimately
lead to saving space on CRAN and improving package efficiency.

Overview: This package aims to provide the most useful subset
of Boost libraries for template use among CRAN packages.  This
offers a more efficient distribution system for CRAN because
replication of this code is avoided.

Benefits: 

(1) Immediately: packages bigmemory and synchronicity
currently distribute large chunks of the libraries.
With BoostHeaders on CRAN, this will no longer be necessary,
with savings not just for the packages, but for all future
updates of the packages.  We have tested this for bigmemory
and synchronicity and can upload the revisions as soon as
BoostHeaders is available.  Package mspath also distributes
a large Boost tree, and we hope similar trivial changes
will contribute similar efficiencies.

(2) About a dozen other packages (including GUTS, MBA, RcppBDT,
and more) rely upon system versions of Boost.  We hope these
might become "easier" to use and maintain and more portable
by use of the BoostHeaders package.  This should be as simple as
taking advantage of LinkingTo: as provided by CRAN.

(3) "Out of box" Boost libraries sometimes require "patches"
for Windows; thus, relying on user-installed libraries does
not provide portability.  This is partly the reason for
the current version of bigmemory not supporting Windows.

(4) The future: we hope this will pay off down the road with
increasing use of Boost, helping to streamling this (admittedly
small) aspect of CRAN.

Thanks,

Jay, Mike, Dirk, JJ, and Romain
