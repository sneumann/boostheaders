Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
  libraries.  We place them in this package as a more efficient
  distribution system for CRAN.  The idea is that you can write
  a package that depends on some subset of the Boost Libraries,
  and you won't need to distribute a copy of this code with your
  package.
